You have to install helmet version 3.21.3 and require it in the `myapp.js`.
Add a dependency in package.json, add the required package either by using the npm command or manually selecting the package version.

Then in the myapp.js file, add the statement to require it. 

```
const helmet = require('helmet');

```
